# MeroX & StavroX

**Cross-linking Mass Spectrometry Analysis Software**

MeroX and StavroX are comprehensive software tools for identifying cross-links of peptides in complex mixtures using mass spectrometry analysis. As of version 2.0, MeroX includes all StavroX functionality, providing a unified platform for cross-link identification and analysis. StavroX identifies all kinds of cross-linked peptides (including DSS, BSÂ³, disulfides, zero-length cross-linkers), while MeroX specializes in identifying cross-links from MS-cleavable cross-linkers (CID-cleavable). Both software solutions utilize advanced algorithms for automated assignment and scoring of cross-linked products in protein structural analysis.

## System Requirements

### Java Version Requirements

- **Versions 2014-2018**: Requires Java â‰¥8
- **Version 2024**: Requires Java â‰¥21

Please ensure you have the appropriate Java version installed before running the software.

## Key Features

- Identification of protein cross-links from mass spectrometry data
- Support for MS-cleavable cross-linkers
- Advanced scoring algorithms with FDR control
- Graphical user interface for data visualization
- Multi-threading support for improved performance
- Support for multiple file formats including mzML

## Visualization and Analysis Tools

### XLDataGraph
Results from MeroX can be visualized and analyzed using the **XLDataGraph** Python library:
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/a-helix/XLDataGraph](https://github.com/a-helix/XLDataGraph)
- **Features**: Circos protein interaction plots, Venn diagrams, Gephi network exports, ChimeraX integration, structural predictions
- **File Support**: Direct import of MeroX `.zhrm` files with domain annotations, FASTA sequences, and structural data

### xVis Web Server
Cross-link data can also be visualized using **xVis** for schematic visualization and interpretation of crosslink-derived spatial restraints. The web server displays crosslinks in clear schematic representations including circular, bar, and network diagrams with interactive features for topological and functional interpretation.
